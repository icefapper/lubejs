These are files that will hopefully help you reproduce the segv error in node v5.*; my experience with this weirdo is in lubelean.log; if you want to record your own log, delete lubelean.log and run the 'run.sh' thing for 40 times or so , and then take a look at the lubelean.log to get an idea on what the hell is happening ; best of luck !
